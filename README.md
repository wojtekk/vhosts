Description
===========

This cookbook allows configuration of apache2 vhosts using attributes and the definition provided by the apache2 cookbook.

The attributes can be set at any of the following levels:

    name 'rails'
    description 'The rails application server role.'

    run_list 'recipe[apache2]', 'recipe[apache2::mod_ssl]', 'recipe[vhosts]'

    override_attributes(
      'apache2' => {
        'vhosts' => {
          'name' => 'rails.company.com',
          'aliases' => [ 'content-test.optimispt.com' ],
